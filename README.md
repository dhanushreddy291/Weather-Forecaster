# Weather Forecaster

A simple Weather App built using React, GraphsJS and Bootstrap, using WeatherAPI.com to provide the Weather forecast for any city

# Inspiration

I wanted to learn React the hard way. By hard way, I mean getting my feet dirty and building apps using React. Whats a better learning path than practically trying things, failing in the process, fixing the bugs and finally making it live.

# APIs

- Weather data is retrieved from http://weatherapi.com/

# Some errors observed in the Weather API Data

- The data being fed to the graph is not that accurate. Since I am using free API source for the weather Data, I cannot complain much. It's just about upgrading to a paid data provider like Yahoo Weather or AccuWeather to get a fully relaible feed.

# Running

## API keys

- Get your API key from http://weatherapi.com/ and store it in a variable named REACT_APP_API_KEY in your env file.
